		 <h3>Original Text</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The image to the right is a snapshot of the advertisement for the City Stove Establishment, run by Robert Peace & Co., seller of stoves, tinware, and apparently, bath and water heaters. 
         <p>This advertisement appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of September 2nd, 1865.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The exact location of the City Stove Establishment cannot be discovered, as the original site burned in the Great Fire of 1892. Following the fire, the office of the establishment was at least temporarily moved to 427 Water Street, at a Mrs. W.J. Scott's.</p>

         <p>While little can be found on the location and nature of the City Stove Establishment, much can be found on Robert Peace himself, the owner of Robert Peace & Co. He was born in West Parish Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland, in 1821. In 1846 he married Margaret Sharp Ferguson, the author of a published book of poems entitled 'The Convict Ship and Other Poems'. The two emigrated from Scotland to St. John's in 1847. Peace established himself as a merchant of stoves and tinware.</p>
         <p>In addition to being a succesful merchant, Peace was an active member of St. Andrew's Presbyterian church, and served on the Committee of Charity of St. Andrew's Society. The parents of eleven children, Peace and his wife emigrated from Newfoundland to Auckland, New Zealand, in 1865, together with the Foote family (also of St. John's). Having settled in Auckland, Peace established a successful plumbing business. He died in Auckland on 19th July, 1908.</p>
