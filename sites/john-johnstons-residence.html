         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The ancient city of Antinoöpolis is best known today as Sheikh ‘Ibada. It was founded around 130 A.D. by Roman emperor Hadrian. The city was named after his lover Antinous who drowned in the Nile River not to far from where Antinoöpolis is located. As stories tell it Antinous throw him self in the river to save his lover Hadrian. This historical city itself was built on top of a temple of Rameses II. The city was also referred to as Antinoe, Antenon, Adrianopolis, and Besantinopolis throughout its history. The city was soon populated with many Greeks and the native Egyptians. However by the 10th century the city was completely deserted and later on was destroyed by the removal of the cities structures. (3)</p>

		 <h3>Geography</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Hadrian nevertheless showed no care to the fact he was building on top of a monument. He had plans to create a memory and detection for his dear lover Antinous who died in the Nile. As stories soon spread about Antinous death, and tales of how he sacrificed his life to save Hadrian spread. It is also said that when you die in the Nile the god Osiris claims your life and one day you will become Osiris. During this time of healing Hadrian had many statues, temples, a religion, holiday and shrines built in his lovers honor. Antinous was not just any god But a Gay God. Due to the fact of his sexuality it is said that when the city converted to Christianity, this was a problem that created conflict. However thought all this conflict Antinous is one the well known faces of today. Although the location and name of the city was detected to Antinous, Hadrian had already planned to found a city during his trip to Hermopolis. This city was planed to have great roads, a theater and was to withhold political power among other things, which it did. (Bell,1940)</p>
		 <p>Antinoopolis was specific located on the east banks of the Nile River between Upper and Lower Egypt. It sits exactly opposite of Hermopolis, and a little to the south of a town called Besa. Which is said to be a little ways from the spot Antinous died. The site itself has a massive natural valley that runs through its center, which were the results of flooding’s from the Nile due to the desert hills. The city can be described as about three in half miles wide and having three brick walls surrounding it leaving the river open. There were sidewalks and roads, at the intersections of these roads where many place where people traded. The 800km Via Hadriana road, which connected the city to the red sea, was also an historical landmark such as Besa to port Berenike. Also the city had many baths, temples, statues and buildings. It had an amazing architecture at the gates entrance from the Nile. It was designed with an arch and two columns with statues beside them.(smith,1854)</p>
         <p>This connection was of importance because it made Antinoöpolis the center for trade. Because you could not get to curtain places by land many traveled by water. Due to the precise location of Antinoopolis being between the red sea and the Nile, people from India to far china brought gold, silks and exotic spices to traded along this route with the Greeks and Romans. Along this route were other cities, which help strength relationships among the people of the neighboring settlements. Not surprisingly this road was not that safe due the high volume of traffic thieves found it very beneficial. (Bell,1940)</p>

		 <h3>Excavation</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Edme Jomard accompanied Napoleons army in 1798 was among the first to conduct a survey of Antinoopolis. He physically created a walk through map of the site. Edme François Jomard was one of the few researchers who made a great documentation of the cities sites with great detail. He described the structures of the marble, granite and limestone. His findings were among the last to be noted about ancient Antinoopolis because later on some of these landmark were destroyed. The destroyed materials themselves were used to build other things in Cairo. (Bard, & Shubert, 1999)</p>

		 <p>The first major excavation of Antinoopolis occurred from 1896 to 1912 under Albert Gayet. Gayet is considered to be anthropologist of Antinoopolis. He was the first to discover an ancient Egyptian temple dedicated to Rameses II underneath the city. He also found a number of burial grounds outside of the city. (Haase, & Temporini,1984). The most interesting found of all was the burial style and adornment. Remains from Antinoopolis were completely clothed and accompanied by a painted mask, Unlike the Egyptians who mummified the dead. These painting however became known as the Fayum Mummy Portraits. Among other things Gayet found crosses and inscriptions, which signifies the people of Antinoopolis were Christians. (D’Amato, 11-13).</p>
		 <p>John Johnson was of the next to excavate Antinoopolis and he discovered the papyri documents. Among these documents the Two Theocritus Papyri were of great importance. These papyrus contained records of testaments, government processes, loans, and contracts. It also discussed how Antinoopolis chose its own President and Senate (Roberts, 1953). John was not your average archaeologist; he was a printer at the University of Oxford. It was then in the rubbish of the Byzantine library that these documents were found. The conditions of the documents were brittle and a moisture treatment was done to restore them. (Hunt,1931)</p>
		 <p>The Institutes of Florence and the University of Rome also excavated the site in the 1960’s. A major find during this excavation was at a shrine of Antinous were over 500,000 jars of offerings were located. As of today the site still remains under the control of the Institutes of Florence (Bard, & Shubert, 1999). They continue to find pottery and other ceramics an artifact. Their primary goal is to seek out the reasons as to why the city’s abandonment in the 10th century.</p>
         <br>
         <h3>Results</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Napoleon’s excavation proved to be important to archaeological studies because it shows the very last details of the city before it was to destroy in the 10th century. Edme Jomard did a great job in describing the site to detail. His notes of his observation were good enough to give people a mental picture of what the city looked liked before being destroyed. Albert Gayet findings of Christianity were of great importance because it paved a clear understanding of religion in during this time. The finding of the Fayum Mummy Portraits, which he had set out to find were the results of understanding how the Greek and roman population flourished because it was no other city in which both had lived together. John Johnson had the most important finding of them all. He discovered the papyri’s, which resulted in evidence of political records of the government and other important information about how the city was governed. (Roberts,1953) The institution of Florence excavation resulted in the findings of offerings dedicated to Antinous. This shows that he played a major role in the lives of the people in Antinoopolis as the worshiped him. Today the University of Florence still has control of the site and hopes of finding new discoveries. Researchers at the University are hoping to find answers as to why the city was abandoned around the 10th century.</p>

         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Antinoöpolis is an important archaeological findings because it existing during many time periods such the old Kingdom to the 19th century. The site itself answers many question about more than one civilization, but the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Antinoopolis is not just a monument along but has many discoveries within it and outside of it. Antinoopolis plays a major role in the history of trade and religion in Egypt. Because of the trade route Antinoopolis was connected to many other historical sites, such as Berenike, Hermopolis and Besa. It also sheds light on how two groups of people can coexist and create one stable environment. This site also shows the significant changes in the care for people in the after life. It papyri’s also demonstrates the change from royal power to power of the people. Antinoopolis is apart if Egyptian archeology because the site holds key to the cultural aspects of the people in Antinoopolis who worshiped Antinous and later on converted to Christianity. It supports the facts that Egyptians lived among the Greeks and Romans, sometimes getting married.</p>
