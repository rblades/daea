		 <h3>Original Text</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The images to the right are snapshots of advertisements placed by Frederick R. Page and Homer Joslyn, for events taking place in the Market House. These ads ran in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of 30th and 31st August, 1865.</p>		

		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The Market-House of 1865 stood on the aptly-named Market House Hill and was part of a complex which housed both the market-house and the court-house. The History of Market House Hill is a testament to the fact that fire played an important role in shaping the architectural and structural development of St. John's during the course of the 19th century.  The first building on this location was the 1730 courthouse, a wooden structure which was rebuilt in 1831 due to age and decay. This second building was destroyed in the fire of 1846, and in the early 1850's was replaced by the dual market-house and court-house structure which is the subject of this discussion. This building was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1892, after which the site was abandoned and the houses moved to a different location.  In 1899, a new court-house was built on the original site of Market House Hill, and this structure stands to this day, retaining its original function as St. John's Courthouse, at 194 Water Street.</p>

         <h3>Further Research</h3>
         <hr>
         <p><b>Frederick R. Page</b></p> 
         <p>Frederick Rowden Page was an auctioneer, land-surveyor, and real-estate agent.  His business headquarters were located in the Market House, and he boarded at 5 Cathedral Hill, the street now known as Church Hill.  Page was part of the St. John's Athenaeum, a literary club or book society whose intent was to increase cultural and literary interest in St. John's. He held the position of Curator of Apparatus for the Athenaeum.</p>
         <p><b>Homer Joslyn</b></p>
         <p>Homer Joslyn, originally from Batavia, USA (state unspecified), was the owner of the St. John's Sewing Machine Depot, located in the Market House. In the first half of 1865 he resided in a boarding house at 78 Prescott Street, up to but presumably not after September 27th, 1865, on which date he was married in St. Paul's Church, St. John's, to Elizabeth Walker, originally of New York.</p>
