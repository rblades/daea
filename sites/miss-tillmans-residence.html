		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The image to the right is a snapshot of the advertisement placed by Miss Tillman which appears in the Morning Chronicle of September 2nd, 1865.</p>

		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Miss Tillman's Residence was located at 16 Cochrane Street. The building is no longer extant, and was probably destroyed by the fire of 1892, as was much of downtown core of St. John's. The location on the map marks the modern location of 16 Cochrane Street and is approximate, rather than exact, as the division of roads into numbered units has probably changed since the 1800's.</p>
         <br>

         <p>References to Miss Tillman and to 16 Cochrane Street were extremely slim. There is, in fact, only one that could be found. Hutchinson's Newfoundland Directory of 1864-1865, which lists businesses and merchants and their addresses, lists a Miss Mary Tillman as the proprietress of a variety store at 204 Water Street.  The entry also lists 16 Cochrane Street, which--given the information provided in her advertisement in the Morning Chronicle--can be definitively identified as her personal residence.</p>
         <p>It is interesting to note that there was relatively little information to be found on Mary Tillman, compared to other merchants. This is likely due to her gender.  Many of the names of other (male) merchants can be found in a variety of sources, including biographies of important Canadian figures as well as lists of professional and political membership.  My research has indicated that many merchants in St. John's in the 1800s also had secondary careers as politicans, and these facts mean that the social exposure of these men would have been far higher than would be that of a woman shop-keeper, particularly an unmarried one, and helps explain the greater number of historical documents in which their names can be found.</p>
         <p>Attempts at locating further information about the variety store at 204 Water Street were futile.  No further references to the business, or to the location, could be found.</p>
