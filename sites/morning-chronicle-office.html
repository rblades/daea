      <h3>Corner of Duckworth St. and Cathedral St.</h3>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
		 <h3>Original Text</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The image to the right is a snapshot of the editorial text which appeared as the introduction in every issue of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> between August 30th and September 2nd, 1865.</p>		
		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The building which housed the office of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> is no longer extant, and the corners of Duckworth and Cathedral streets currently house buildings that were all built after the fire of 1892.  This suggests that the original building was probably destroyed in that fire, if not before. The exact location of this building is therefore unknown, beyond its location on one of the corners where these two streets meet.</p>

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>While little can be said of the original building of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, more can be said of Francis Winton, the man who created, edited and published the paper. Born around 1829 in St. John's, Winton began his publisher career with the <i>St.John's Daily News</i> in 1860, which he ran with his brother Robert.</p> 
         <p>In 1862, Winton left the <i>Daily News</i> and published another newspaper, the <i>Day Book</i>, which he renamed the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in 1865. The <i>Chronicle</i> became St. John's principle anti-confederate newspaper, and the mouthpiece for Winton's disapproval of the prevelance of religious opinion in political matters.  In 1869, Winton ran for one term as the elected anti-confederate representative in the riding of Bonavista.</p> 
         <p>Winton left St. John's sometime before 1894 for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he ran a paper which was also called the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. He died in Pittsburgh, within days of the death of his wife, Susan, in 1908.</p>
